I'm currently a first year mathematics PhD at UT Austin.

Before that I did my [M2 de Mathématiques Fondamentales](https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/index.php) at Sorbonne Université with the help of the Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris' [PGSM Master scholarship](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/nos-programmes/pgsm-master). 

Before that I graduated from the [Australian National University](https://maths.anu.edu.au/) with the PhB - Science (Honours). 

I wrote my Honours thesis under the supervision of Associate Professor [Uri Onn](https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/uri-onn), in which I studied a [paper by Lubotzky and Martin](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02916715.pdf) on the congruence subgroup property and polynomial representation growth.  To read my Honours thesis [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jC2kLG03orK0WyAvsnkJrMl4wNyyvnB/view?usp=sharing).

I am interested broadly in number theory, algebraic geometry and its connections with representation theory.
