### About

<img style="float: right;" src="./assets/images/headshot_photo.png" width="200">

I'm a pure mathematics student from Australia. When not doing mathematics I enjoy bouldering and solving cryptic crosswords. 

I'm currently a first year graduate student at UT Austin.

Before that I did my [M2 de Mathématiques Fondamentales](https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/index.php) at Sorbonne Université with the help of the Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris' [PGSM Master scholarship](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/nos-programmes/pgsm-master). I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of [Alexis Bouthier](https://perso.imj-prg.fr/alexis-bouthier/) on the geometric Satake equivalence.

Before that I graduated from the Australian National University with the PhB - Science (Honours). 

I wrote my Honours thesis under the supervision of Associate Professor [Uri Onn](https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/uri-onn), in which I studied a [paper by Lubotzky and Martin](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02916715.pdf) on the congruence subgroup property and polynomial representation growth.  To read my Honours thesis [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jC2kLG03orK0WyAvsnkJrMl4wNyyvnB/view?usp=sharing).

I also made a short video describing some of the ideas in my Honours thesis, which should be comprehensible to any undergraduate who knows what a representation is. You can view this [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X_krFNTOTr2GyhALDfT-_sZ2oo7jAS3C/view?usp=sharing) (apologies for the audio).

I am interested in number theory, algebraic geometry and its connections with representation theory, though my interests are liable to change as I encounter new mathematics.
