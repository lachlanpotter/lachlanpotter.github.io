### Talks

The following are a selection of recorded mathematical talks I have given:

The Representations and Subgroups of SL_d(Z) (2021)
A 12 minute video describing the ideas in my Honours thesis. It should be comprehensible to any undergraduate student who knows what a representation is.

The sum of reciprocals of primes diverges (2021)
We prove that the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges. We use nothing more than the power series for log. This 8 minute talk was done as part of my Honours year, where students were asked to record a short talk discussing a piece of mathematics they like.
