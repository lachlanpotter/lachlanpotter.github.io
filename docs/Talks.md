### Talks

The following are a selection of recorded mathematical talks I have given:

[The Representations and Subgroups of SL_d(Z) (2021)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DKZTXKVIyogIHoKCsKuoYHGfy0is8fc6/view?usp=sharing)

A 12 minute video describing the ideas in my Honours thesis. It should be comprehensible to any undergraduate student who knows what a representation is.

[The sum of reciprocals of primes diverges (2021)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtUBmIVBB0cW-53HFsbZNMDxvnr4pCN5/view?usp=sharing)

We prove that the sum of reciprocals of primes diverges. We use nothing more than the power series for log. This 8 minute talk was done as part of my Honours year, where students were asked to record a short talk discussing a piece of mathematics they like.
