  I'm a pure mathematics student from Australia. When not doing mathematics I enjoy bouldering and solving cryptic crosswords. 
  I'm currently a first year graduate student at UT Austin. 

description2: > # doing this for paragraph breaks
  Before that I did my M2 de Mathématiques Fondamentales at Sorbonne Université with the help of the Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris' PGSM Master scholarship. I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of Alexis Bouthier on the geometric Satake equivalence.

description3: > # doing this for paragraph breaks
  Before that I graduated from the Australian National University with the PhB - Science (Honours). 
  I wrote my Honours thesis under the supervision of Associate Professor Uri Onn , in which I studied a paper by Lubotzky and Martin on the congruence subgroup property and polynomial representation growth.  To read my Honours thesis click here.
  I also made a short video describing some of the ideas in my Honours thesis, which should be comprehensible to any undergraduate who knows what a representation is. You can view this here  (apologies for the audio).

  I am interested in number theory, algebraic geometry and its connections with representation theory, though my interests are liable to change as I encounter new mathematics.
